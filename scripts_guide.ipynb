    "# Evaluating and improving transformers pre-trained on ASTs for Code Completion: Code Guide\n",
    "This guide can be regarded as supplementary material to my thesis: `Evaluating and Improving Generative Pre-Trained Transformers for Code Completion`. The thesis introduces eight research questions, each of investigates another aspect of the AST based GPT-2 model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python 3.8.5\n",
    "- PyTorch 1.8.1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparation\n",
    "- Clone the project from github.com/derochs/code-prediction-transformer\n",
    "- Download the py150k dataset and merge `python50k_eval` and `python100k_train` JSON files into a single file inside of the cloned repository, for example in `/data/python150k.json`. The resulting dataset should contain `150,000` lines, each line resembling a single AST."

    "## RQ1: How does the baseline model perform when reproduced?\n",
    "This research question intends to establish a baseline model required for comparison with models from other research questions. As baseline model the `trav_trans` model from github.com/facebookresearch/code-prediction-transformer is used. The following scripts for this research question originate from this repository. In order to prepare the data, train and evaluate the model, the following instructions have to be followed:"

    "As `INPUT` you can use the `data/python150k.json` dataset, `OUTPUT` is the JSON file which contains the processed ASTs, by default this path is set to `/tmp/new_trees.json`. You may have to specify the output path yourself because the default path is an absolute path, so probably `tmp/new_trees.json` is the better way to go, without the leading forward-slash.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: This script will iterate through each line of the INPUT dataset. Remember, every line resembles an AST. For each Abstrac Syntax Tree, the script will iterate through all tree nodes. Currently a node can hold a `TYPE`, a `VALUE` or both. The `trav_trans` model however expects only **either** a `TYPE` node **or** a `VALUE` node. Threfore, if the script finds a node containing both, a type and a value, it will remove the value from the node and re-add it as child node. A simple visualization can be found [in the original project\\`s README](https://github.com/facebookresearch/code-prediction-transformer#modifying-the-ast)."

    "As `INPUT` the pre-processed ASTs will be used, in our example it's `tmp/new_trees.json`. `OUTPUT` is the output path of the sequenced ASTs, by default `/tmp/dps.txt`, again, probably you don't want to use the default one but rather `tmp/dps.txt`. The third argument `CONTEXTS` is the context size of your model: The default model is set to have a context of size `1,000`. This means that in one iteration the model can only process `1,000` elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: The ASTs in the dataset are very likely to exceed the models context size by containing more thatn `1,000` nodes. Therefore, the ASTs are sliced into pieces that contain at most `1,000` nodes. One thing to note here is that the `trav_trans` authors split the ASTs with a sliding window of `CONTEXTS / 2`, in our case `1,000 / 2 = 500`. For example: For an AST with 1,700 elements, the script will output three slices: `[0:1000]`, `[500:1500]`, `[700:1700]`. The sliding window moves `500` elements. If there are no more elements in order to make a `500` element large slide, the last slice will go from `[highest node - CONTEXT:highest node]`, in this case `[1700 - 1000:1700]` or `[700:1700]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The slices contain an additional piece of information: The first slice actually looks like this: `[ast[0:1000],0]`. The last element `0` specifies the last node that has already been visited. In this case it's `0` as it's the first slices. The second slice looks like this: `[ast[500:1500],1000]`. Now the last element is `1000` as the slice may go from `500` to `1500` but the previous slice has already visited element `1000`. The third and last slide would look like this: `[ast[700, 1700],1500]`, as node `1500` has already been visited by the second slice. This additional information is required during the model training process, as the model will only take into account nodes which have not yet been visited in order to avoid taking into account the same nodes twice.\n",

This allows node value predictions to be evaluated against attributes, nums, names, params and strings and node type predictions to be evaluated against calls, assigns, returns, lists, dicts and raises. By having this vast variety of different evaluation categories, the model can be compared to other implementations much more thoroughly: One could determine how well a model performs in string predictions and compare the string-prediction capabilities with another model.\n",
